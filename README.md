# CALIFORNIA ROAD TRIP PLANNER

## Project Description

### User Story

As a California visitor, I want to take a scenic multi-day road trip from Los Angeles to San Francisco along Californiaâ€™s scenic Pacific Coast Highway.  I want to be given information about the top destinations along the route and be presented with the recommended dining options and the nearest Best Western accommodation at each destination.

### Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN I am accessing a California road trip planner from Los Angeles to San Francisco
* WHEN I access the application
* THEN I am given a map of California followed by a list of attractions between Los Angeles and San Francisco
* WHEN I select the desired attractions and click on "Plan My Trip"
* THEN I am presented with four items: (1) a new map of California that highlights the suggested route; (2) A carousel displaying each stop and recommended hotel; (3) A button giving me an option to "Get Directions," and (4) A button giving me an option to save the map and suggested route to Local Storage.
